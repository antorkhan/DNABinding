Features count:

nGrams :  8383
nGDip  : 10000
PSF    : 11296
--------------
Total  : 29679 

nGrams --> AAC + dipeptide composition + tripeptide composition
nGDip  --> Gapped dipeptides of gap between 1 to 20
PSF    --> Position specific existance of amino acids, bigrams and trigrams. (E.g.  Does "ak" exist in positin 10?). For first 10 positions only.


Files with featurized_ prefix are training set features. For test set, the prefix is testFeaturized_

The suffix (before the .csv) represents which feature space was used

"comb" means the combination of all the 3 feature spaces.


CDHIT (40%) on PDB186:
Only 95 sequences remain (only 5 are DNA binding) out of 186
76 sequences are identical with some sequence in the training set
